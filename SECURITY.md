## Critical Security Requirements for Financial Data

### üö® **HIGH PRIORITY SECURITY MEASURES**

#### **1. Data Protection**
- **Encryption at Rest**: All financial data must be encrypted in the database
- **Encryption in Transit**: All API communications must use HTTPS/TLS 1.3
- **PII Protection**: Personal Identifiable Information must be masked/anonymized
- **Financial Data**: Transaction amounts, account balances must be encrypted

#### **2. Authentication & Authorization**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all admin accounts
- **Session Management**: Secure session tokens with proper expiration
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Strict permissions for financial operations
- **Account Lockout**: Automatic lockout after failed login attempts
- **Password Policies**: Strong password requirements with complexity rules

#### **3. API Security**
- **Rate Limiting**: Strict limits on financial API endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all financial inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries only
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection
- **API Authentication**: JWT tokens with proper validation

#### **4. Database Security**
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Strict RLS policies for all tables
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all financial transactions
- **Backup Encryption**: Encrypted database backups
- **Access Controls**: Limited database access with service accounts

#### **5. Infrastructure Security**
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Redirect all HTTP to HTTPS
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of API keys and secrets
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time security event monitoring

### üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST**

#### **Environment Security**
- [ ] All API keys stored in environment variables
- [ ] No secrets committed to version control
- [ ] Production environment isolated from development
- [ ] Secure key rotation policies in place

#### **Authentication Security**
- [ ] Supabase Auth configured with secure settings
- [ ] JWT tokens with proper expiration
- [ ] Session management with secure cookies
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication for admins
- [ ] Account lockout policies implemented

#### **API Security**
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Parameterized queries (no SQL injection)
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Request size limits implemented

#### **Database Security**
- [ ] RLS policies for all tables
- [ ] Encrypted sensitive columns
- [ ] Audit logging for financial operations
- [ ] Regular security scans
- [ ] Backup encryption enabled

#### **Frontend Security**
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code
- [ ] Secure HTTP headers implemented
- [ ] XSS protection measures
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Secure cookie settings

### üîç **SECURITY TESTING REQUIREMENTS**

#### **Regular Security Audits**
- [ ] Monthly dependency vulnerability scans
- [ ] Quarterly penetration testing
- [ ] Annual security architecture review
- [ ] Regular code security reviews

#### **Monitoring & Alerting**
- [ ] Failed login attempt monitoring
- [ ] Unusual transaction pattern detection
- [ ] API abuse monitoring
- [ ] Security event logging and alerting

### üìã **COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS**

#### **Financial Data Regulations**
- **PCI DSS**: If handling payment card data
- **GDPR**: For EU user data protection
- **SOX**: For financial reporting compliance
- **Local Regulations**: Country-specific financial data laws

#### **Data Retention Policies**
- [ ] Define data retention periods
- [ ] Implement secure data deletion
- [ ] Regular data purging procedures
- [ ] Audit trail retention policies

### üö® **INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN**

#### **Security Incident Procedures**
1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further damage
4. **Recovery**: Restore secure operations
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures

### üîß **SECURITY TOOLS & MONITORING**

#### **Recommended Security Tools**
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit, Snyk
- **Code Analysis**: ESLint security rules, SonarQube
- **Runtime Protection**: Rate limiting, WAF
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging, anomaly detection

#### **Security Metrics to Track**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Database access anomalies
- Security vulnerability counts
- Incident response times

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL REMINDER**

**Financial data is highly sensitive and regulated. Any security breach could result in:**
- Legal liability
- Regulatory fines
- Loss of customer trust
- Business reputation damage
- Financial losses

**Always prioritize security over convenience when working with financial data.**
